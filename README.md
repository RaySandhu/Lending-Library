# Lending-Library
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4bbec547-be25-4a72-aaf4-d0584c9633b7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lendinglibrarybythelads/deploys)


A collaborative effort to create an online library for my personal collection of books at home with functions to add new books to the library, lending books via check in 
and check out functions, track reading progresses for my partner and myself. Above all, this is an application of my new knowledge working with ReactJS and a first attempt
at collaborative development and its nuances. I will post updates here as this will be a public work in progress.

## Dec 24
A wire frame and function list is prepared and the team is prepared with a working knowledge of React and JS. Initial goals TBD.

## Dec 30
Great beginning steps complete with clear goal setting by team. MVP standards set by listing of minimum functions necessary. 

Ray: completed basic CSS, Navbar, component organization, status update forms, and addition of modal components.

BNor - Bookcards, status update forms

Satwick - Bookcards, search and sort library functions


Goals moving forward:
- Refine CSS for forms and bookcards
- Complete a Book Description component
- Check in/out and Add New Book forms
- Introduce DB usage

<p> One month into the project, the DB is set up but not connected for usage. The Google Books API is connected and functional for searching books outside the library. The upcoming goals are to complete modals and attached forms to add new books to the library with all desired information from the API and the user. Current learning challenges are navigating multiple modals per page as the current modals are not using the React Modal dependency. Likely going to be reworked to utilize React Modal instead of building DOM Portals for each modal. Good practice either way. Next step will be connecting the DB so the user can interact with it as required. This includes add new, delete and edit functions fro stored books. Ongoing mentorship as required from BNor and Satwick.
